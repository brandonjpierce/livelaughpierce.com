        <p>
          Corinne and Brandon had known of each other since highschool through
          common friends but had never met before. Until... on July 4th, 2013 at
          a bar called Mulligans, Corinne approached Brandon to say hello. They
          caught up like they were old friends and went on with their night
          separately. It was not until much later that Corinne realized they had
          never met before that night. Time goes on and their friend Casey found
          out they had spoken to one another and decided to play matchmaker and
          set them up on a date. The rest is history!
        </p>
        <p>
          Corinne and Brandon began officially dating on August 1st, 2013. After
          four years of dating they knew they wanted to get married so they
          decided to get engaged!
